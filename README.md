# Optimizing Bridge Condition and Repair in Allegheny County
This is our final project for the Decision Analytics for Business and Policy course at Heinz College, Fall 2022. Our group wanted to explore the following questions: 
1. What variables  are associated with poor, fair and good bridge condition in Allegheny County?
2. Is there evidence of social inequity in the distribution of bridges in poor condition?
3. How can Allegheny County optimize the allocation of bridge repair funds?

## Instructions for running code:
Please run the .ipynb files in the following order: 
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning*
2. Socioeconomic data cleaning*
3. Classification Models
4. Optimization

*These two files will output dataframes titled 'df' and 'df_norm'. These will serve as our two main dataframes to pass through the model functions.
